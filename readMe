This is a little project I've built in Java for my jobhunting. 
It's a Selenium based test automating script which checks whether a user can acces the http://automationpractice.com website and register with valid credentails.
The code is split into a Page Object Model where each site you'd access along the way has it's own proper class and the main test starts from BaseTest.
There is a HomePage class which I've ommited from the test since I didn't want to go over 3 different pages for each test, but it can be easily brough back by starting the test in BaseTest from HomePage instead of IntermediatePage.
I've shown use of the PageObject model, Selenium based methods in Java, the use of drivers, assertation and waiting commands.
